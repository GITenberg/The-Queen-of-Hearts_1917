description: An early innovator in the genre of mystery and detective fiction, Wilkie
  Collins gained an enormous readership during his lifetime. Though many readers became
  hooked on his work due to his meticulous plotting and mastery with suspense, critics
  say that Collins' popularity endured as a result of his incisive social insight
  and commentary. "The Queen of Hearts" is a masterpiece of Victorian-era detective
  fiction and a rewarding read for fans of classic mysteries.
